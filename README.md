## This is a sample text to edit the file which was downloaded from my github repo and should be added (committed) to the local repo first and then push to origin remote repo on git hub.

I closed my powersell and then edit this file. I want to know if I can push the new changes again by simply openning the powershell and typing git commands or not.
