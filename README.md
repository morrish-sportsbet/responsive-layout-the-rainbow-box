## This is a sample text to edit the file which was downloaded from my github repo and should be added (committed) to the local repo first and then push to origin remote repo on git hub.

I closed my powersell and then edit this file. I want to know if I can push the new changes again by simply openning the powershell and typing git commands or not. Yes, this works.

Now, I am editing the file on the github, remote repository, to know how to clone, pull new changes to my local repo.

Yes, I saw the above edition on my local pc, after running the "git push origin master" command. Of course, the directory should be the same as working directory defined for the git. Now, I want to push just added comments to the remote repository again.
Another change on the remote repo to test the pull command.
